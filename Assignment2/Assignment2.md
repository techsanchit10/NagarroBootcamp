1. Write a Python class named Circle constructed by a radius and two methods which will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle. Also write functions to compare (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=) 2 circles on the basis of their radius.


2. Write a program which takes a text file as input and does following operations sequentially over it:
	- Create a list of words present in file
	- Convert all words to uppercase (using map)
	- Remove the words from list which contain 'a' (using filter)
	- Generate a string by concatenating all the words in the final list (using reduce)


3. Go through the available public apis listed here: https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis. Select any 2 of your favorite APIs and write a python script to:

	- collect data from those APIs
	- save the data in a file (json/txt file)


4. Create a simple flask application in which:
	- user can enter any query
	- show a wikipedia summary of the topic to the user.
