1. Given an integer n, print a nXn matrix with squares (outermost to innermost) having values n, then n-1 and so on.
	For example, given 5, output is:
	```
	5 5 5 5 5
	5 4 4 4 5
	5 4 3 4 5
	5 4 4 4 5 
	5 5 5 5 5
	```


2. Write a python program to print this pattern:
    For n = 5:
    ```
        *
       ***
      *****
     *******
    *********
    ```


3. Write a python program to print this pattern:
    For n = 5:
	```
			A
		   ABA
		  ABCBA
	     ABCDCBA
		ABCDEDCBA
	```


4. Write a recursive function to print all possible strings of length k that can be formed from a set of n characters.


5. Write a simple Python program which inputs and stores the data about university students as a list of dictionaries. Your final record structure should look like this:
    ```
     [
         {
             'roll-no': 1211,
             'name': 'Ravi',
             'branch': 'CSE'
         },
         {
             'roll-no': 202,
             'name': 'Abhishek',
             'branch': 'SE'
         },
         {
             'roll-no': 1202,
             'name': 'Sachin',
             'branch': 'IT'
         }
     ]
    ```


6. Write a program to find second maximum number in a list.


7. Explore the `os` module in Python and write a Python program to:
	- List all files in a folder entered by user.
	- Rename any given file in the specified folder


8. Explore the random module and create a number guessing game using it.
